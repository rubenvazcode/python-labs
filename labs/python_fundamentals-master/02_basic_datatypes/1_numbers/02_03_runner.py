'''

If a runner runs 10 miles in 30 minutes and 30 seconds,
What is his/her average speed in kilometers per hour? (Tip: 1 mile = 1.6 km)

'''
# define how many miles per hour
mph = (60*10/30.3)
# present the result
print("The runner runs a average of", (mph * 1.6), "km/h!")

# or
kmh = (mph * 1.6)
print(kmh, "km/h")
